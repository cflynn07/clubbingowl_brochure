ClubbingOwl’s unique Facebook integration not only gives venues and promoters unprecedented opportunities to virally grow the exposure of their guest-lists and events through the friend-network of their clientele, it also provides extremely consistent, reliable and useful analytics.

Other management systems rely on promoters and staff to manually type the names of their clients into a cumbersome database. This process is error-prone, time consuming, and doesn’t lead to quality analytics.

ClubbingOwl’s unique integration into the Facebook platform makes it easy to track clientele. Everyone on Facebook has a unique identifier that can be used to organize your client database. Other management systems have no way of knowing if “John smith” and “John Smith” are the same, or two different people with the same name.

Not to mention the sign up process for clients to join guest lists is just as frustrating and slow. With ClubbingOwl, a client can join your guest list with just a single click. And you get a ton of useful data.
