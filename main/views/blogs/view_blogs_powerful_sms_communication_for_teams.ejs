To make it easier to respond to your clients and organize your team, ClubbingOwl features a unique SMS communication system. Promoters and managers are notified whenever they have a new guest list request, and can respond directly to the SMS to accept/decline it.

Managers can send out SMS notifications to all members of their team when they need to make sure everyone is updated ASAP.
<br><br>
Ever tried to send an update to everyone on your guest list? You’ve probably had to switch between BBM, iMessage, SMS, Facebook chat, email, carrier pidgeon, smoke signals and phone calls. Now there’s an easier way. Instantly update everyone on your guest list in seconds by updating your guest lists’s “status” in ClubbingOwl. Your update will be delivered to all of your clients by SMS/Email.

These are just some of the many ways ClubbingOwl helps your team work together and be more efficient.
